# CS1510-HW01
Data Structures Fall 2015

Given grid(s) of integers, this program finds the row / column combination of minimum value. 

## Input:
The first line of the input gives the number of grid maps T.  For each grid map, the first line contains the numbers W and H; the width and height of the grid map.  (W and H will be greater than or equal to 2). H rows of W data points follow, describing the number of penguins in each cell of the grid map.

## Output
For each grid map, output one line containing "#g: (c, r) p", where g is the grid number (starting from 0), (c, r) is the column/row where the least penguins will have to be evicted, and p is the number of penguins that will get evicted. The top-left corner of the grid map is coordinate (0,0).
